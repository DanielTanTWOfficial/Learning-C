/*  PROBLEM: Write a program that takes in user credentials (username and password), stores them in a MongoDB database
    collection (with the password hashed and salted), and then takes in user input passwords and returns the relevant
    username with that password to the user.
    E.g.
    Username: Benny
    Password: P@ssw0rd
    Enter password: P@ssw0rd
    User with that password is Benny
    OR
    No user with this password exists
